## 📌 Project Overview

This project provides a **hands-on introduction to Ethical Hacking and Cybersecurity**, focusing on practical lab setup, foundational concepts, and controlled security testing environments.  
It is designed for **students, beginners, and cybersecurity enthusiasts** to understand how attackers operate and how systems are secured—**ethically and legally**.

---

## 🔐 Key Concepts Covered

### Hacking
Hacking is the process of exploiting system vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access by modifying system or application behavior beyond its original purpose.

### Ethical Hacking
Ethical Hacking involves **authorized testing** of systems using attacker techniques to identify vulnerabilities and improve security posture.

### Hacker vs Ethical Hacker
- **Hacker:** Explores systems to find exploitable weaknesses.
- **Ethical Hacker:** Identifies vulnerabilities **with permission**, without causing harm, on behalf of system owners.

---

## 👨‍💻 Types of Hackers
- **Black Hat:** Malicious attackers  
- **White Hat:** Defensive security professionals  
- **Gray Hat:** Mixed intent  
- **Script Kiddies:** Tool-based attackers  
- **Hacktivists:** Politically motivated attackers  
- **Cyber Terrorists:** Infrastructure disruptors  
- **State-Sponsored Hackers:** Government-backed attackers  

---

## 🛡️ Why Ethical Hacking Is Necessary
- Prevent cybercrime  
- Protect sensitive information  
- Test organizational security controls  
- Build proactive defense mechanisms  
- Anticipate attacker behavior  

---

## 🧭 Ethical Hacking Lifecycle
1. **Reconnaissance** – Information gathering  
2. **Scanning** – Identifying vulnerabilities  
3. **Gaining Access** – Exploitation  
4. **Maintaining Access** – Persistence techniques  
5. **Clearing Tracks** – Log and evidence removal

## 📘 Information Security (InfoSec)

Information Security ensures the **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)** of data.

### Core Elements
- Confidentiality  
- Integrity  
- Availability  
- Authentication  
- Authorization  
- Non-Repudiation  

---

## 🔺 Security–Functionality–Usability Triangle
Security strength is defined by balancing:
- Security
- Functionality
- Usability

---

## 🌐 Networking & Privacy Concepts
- **IP Tracing & Lookup**
- **IP Spoofing**
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**
- **VPS (Virtual Private Server)**
- **Proxy Servers**

---

## 💻 Lab Environment Requirements

### Hardware
